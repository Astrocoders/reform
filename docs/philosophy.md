The ReForm ecosystem aims to provide the necessary tooling to make the developer's life less boring.
Strong type system can be great but sometimes in order to get type safety you need to type a lot of words.
And when the right things to do are more boring than fun/meaningful we tend to do them less often. 
Which shouldn't be the case for something as crucial as keeping our program sound and safe.
That's we we have changed a lot ReForm's API since the first release.

The current version introduces GADTs type system and a ppx to help write them. 
Both things are sometimes considered a bit more advanced usage of the Reason tooling. As they can add a bit more of complexity to the end user we have tried our best to keep the interface as clean and abstracted away possible.
