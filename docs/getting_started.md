## What this is and why

Code that deals with strongly typed forms can quickly become walls of repeated text.
We created ReForm to be both deadly simple and to make forms sound good leveraging ReasonML's powerful typesytem.
Even the schemas we use are nothing more than constructors built-in in the language itself with a small size footprint.

## Features

- Hook API
- Schema API
- Type safe, `handleChange` properly infers the value of the field it is handling
- Context Provider
- Field component
- Validation strategy, OnDemand and OnChange
